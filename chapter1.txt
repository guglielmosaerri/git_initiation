- I used "code" to open this file in VSCode: code chapter1.txt (or use "cat")
- create git repo: git init, to see ls-a
- we are in our working dir > staging area: which files you pick from to commit.
  See: git status > git add chapter1.txt > git commit -m "initial commit" (explain what you are doing in the message)
- Check your commit on git log
- git add the other two files or git add .
